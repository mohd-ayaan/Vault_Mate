        <h2>Your Secure Digital Vault</h2>
        <p>Vault Mate is a privacy-first platform designed to help you securely store, preview, and manage your most important documents—Aadhar, PAN, passports, marksheets, and more. Built with a modular backend and robust authentication, Vault Mate ensures your data stays protected and accessible only to you.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="about-info-block">
        <h2>What We've Built So Far</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>OTP-Based Authentication:</strong> Both signup and login flows are protected by email-based OTP verification for true 2FA.</li>
          <li><strong>Hashed Passwords:</strong> User credentials are securely hashed using bcrypt before storage—no plain text ever.</li>
          <li><strong>Secure Uploads:</strong> Documents are uploaded via memory-based storage and stored in MongoDB with MIME-aware rendering.</li>
          <li><strong>Dynamic Routing:</strong> Each document type is served through a single scalable route with intelligent MIME detection.</li>
          <li><strong>Session Management:</strong> OTPs and user states are securely managed using express-session middleware.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="about-info-block">
        <h2>Why Vault Mate?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Privacy First:</strong> OTP verification ensures only verified users can access their vault.</li>
          <li><strong>Modular Architecture:</strong> Designed for scalability, maintainability, and recruiter-readiness.</li>
          <li><strong>Document Preview:</strong> View uploaded documents directly in-browser with correct MIME types.</li>
          <li><strong>Error-Resilient:</strong> Backend routes are optimized for debugging, validation, and exception handling.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div class="about-info-block">
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Sign up with your mobile number and email. After verifying your OTP, you’ll gain access to your personal vault. Upload documents, preview them instantly, and retrieve them anytime—all protected by secure sessions and hashed credentials.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="about-info-block">
        <h2>Your Privacy, Our Priority</h2>
        <p>Vault Mate never stores passwords in plain text and never shares your data without consent. Every document is stored securely, and every login is verified with OTP to ensure your vault stays yours.</p>
